    <h2>
      A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
    </h2>
    <b>Strengths:</b>
    Openness, curiosity, creative, ability to come up with many ideas, ability
    to execute fast, ability to communicate well and strong
    empathy/interdependent skills, autonomous
    <b>Limitations:</b>
    <p>
      Lack being detail-oriented, can often lose focus, struggle to take time to
      review, reflect, edit and learn things in depth with a deep understanding,
      prefer being told over self discovery type learning.
    </p>

    <h2>
      What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
      developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Problem solving, logical decision-making, reflection, smart project
      management/ prioritization, realistic time management, goal-setting,

    </p>

    <h2>
      A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This
      should include:
    </h2>
    <h3>
      An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and
      safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community
      representatives
    </h3>
    <p>
      The pomodoro technique is incredibly effective for keeping me on track.
      Short but true breaks from screen/thinking. Put aside time for white
      space, reflection, editing. Allot time to asking questions, listening,
      working collaboratively with others and teaching/helping others as well.
      Make sure to communicate boundaries and requests.
    </p>

    <h3>
      What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
    </h3>
    <p>
      Let others know if it affects them - communicate clearly and effectively.
      Write a list of everything and then use the Eisenhower matrix to determine
      what’s most important. Allow myself time to de-stress - whether that be a
      nap, mediation, emotional processing, white space, moving around, yoga,
      going for a walk, drinking water, breathing - be kind to myself in those
      moments.
    </p>

    <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
    <p>
      Definitely from the Facilitators as they’ve likely got the most experience
      when it comes to students burning out. Vocalizing needing space or to be
      non-verbal to my co-workers if I am working with them. Directly asking for
      help after I’ve tried to solve the problem myself.
    </p>

    <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
    <p>
      To listen, be kind, be patient, help with whatever questions I have, and
      explain things to me whenever I don’t understand something. Not just when
      it comes to tech problems, but also any specific concepts that would make
      me overall a better programmer.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed
      to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like
      school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mainly everyday things such as breakfast, lunch, dinner, gym, social
      commitments, travel time. Managing everyday life - calls with friends and
      family, finances, supermarket, petrol, cleaning etc. And definitely need
      to put in white space just for me to relax. I also have a commitment to a
      side project I’ll be working on, my acting classes on Sunday - 6 hours,
      prep for those classes, memorizing script scenes/monologues and accent
      work.
