<h1>CSS Concepts</h1>
<h2>Display Inline vs Inline Blocks</h2>
  <p>
  You are creating a webpage and you've added two boxes.
  You'd like for them to be displayed side by side instead of
  one on top of the other. To do this, you use the display property. 
  </p>

<section>
  <h3>Default - Display Block</h3>
    <p>By default, they look like this.</p>
    <img src="" alt="">
    <p>Code: display: block;</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Display Inline</h3>
  <p>Let's say you'd like them to be side by side from each other.</p>
  <img src="" alt="">
  <p>Code: display: inline;</p>
</section>
