    <div>
      <h2>Javascript's Relationship to HTML and CSS</h2>
      <p>
        Think of a plane. The metal body of the plane is the HTML with its nose,
        body, tail and wings. The paint, colors, branding and logos of the plane
        are the CSS. And the controls/mechanics that allow the plane to take
        off, fly and land are the Javascript Elements.

      <h2>Control Flow and Loops</h2>
      <h3>Control Flow</h3>
      <p>
        Control flow is the order in which statements are executed in a program.
        When you read a book in English, you read each sentence starting at the
        top of the page moving down. And you read sentences from left to right.
        In a traditional Japanese book, you read sentences from right to left.
        The default control flow is for statements to be read and executed in
        order from left to right, top to bottom in a program file.
      </p>
      <h3>Loops</h3>
      <p>
        A loop is a sequence of instructions that are continuously repeated
        until a certain condition is reached. When you’re running a loop around
        an athletics track, every loop is 400m. If you were running a 1.2km
        race, you’d start at 0m. Every time you pass the 400m mark, you’d have
        completed 1 loop. You’d continue running until you’d all the way around
        the track 3 times and completed 1.2km. That would equate to 3 loops.
        Once you know 3 loops are completed, you would stop running. Typically,
        when a certain process is done, such as getting an item of data and
        changing it, then some condition is checked. Such as whether a counter
        has reached a prescribed number.
      </p>
    </div>

      <h2>What is DOM?</h2>
      <p>
        The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web
        documents. You can use it to change the document structure, style and
        content. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a
        document is accessed and manipulated. A way you can interact with the
        DOM is if you wanted to create an alert on the webpage, you could use
        Javascript to not only create it, but write a customized message on that
        alert pop up.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Difference Between Accessing Data</h2>
      <h3>Arrays vs Objects</h3>
      <p>
        Arrays are ‘lists’ of related values. Every value in the array is
        usually of the exact same type and only differentiated by the position
        of the array.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, popular types of dog breeds could be stored in an array
        with the single variable name: popularDogBreeds, and in the array would
        be things such as: [“dalmation”, “labrador”, “poodle”, “pug”, “boxer”,
        “pitbull”, “beagle”, “retriever”]
      </p>
      <p>
        Objects are best described by thinking of a real-world object. Take a
        cat for example. Cats come in all shapes and sizes - different colors,
        different breeds, different fur lengths, different weights etc. Every
        cat has these properties but the values are different from one cat to
        another.
      </p>
      <p>
        A ginger Tabby cat and a white Persian cat are both ‘cats’, but they are
        different breeds, fur colors and fur lengths.
      </p>
      <p>
        Javascript Objects are variables that contain multiple data values.
        These values are known as properties. Objects use keys to name values.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here’s an example of an object: <br />
        Var persianCat = { <br />
        Size: Large, <br />
        Fur Color: White, <br />
        Fur Length: Long <br />
        }
      </p>

      <p>
        The difference between accessing data in an array versus an object, is
        within an array, you only able to retrieve the values based on the
        position of the value in the array.
      </p>
      <p>The first value’s position is [0], the second is [1] and so on.</p>
      <p>
        With an object, you can retrieve any value/s you want based on the keys
        you are calling.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>What are Functions?</h2>
      <p>
        A function is a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a
        value. It should take some input and return an output where there is
        some obvious relationship between the input and the output.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the most simple examples of a function is the adding of two
        numbers together. There is an input - the two numbers = 1 and 2, and an
        output = 3. With a function, you give it a name e.g addNumbers, and you
        create the variables.
      </p>

      <p>
        function addNumbers (num1, num 2) {<br />
        return num1 + num2<br />
        }
      </p>

      <p>
        Above you can see the variables = num1 and num2. And the output ‘return
        num1 + num2’ will show the sum of those two numbers. Now if we declare
        num1 = 1 and num 2 = 2, then the return output would equal 3.
      </p>
      <p>
        Functions are useful because they eliminate code complexity. If you had
        written the above function in many places within your code = 1 + 2 = 3,
        that is known as hard coding and it would be difficult to find and
        edit/change.
      </p>
      <p>
        If ever you wanted to change your numbers of the equation, you’d have to
        go back through your entire document and find each one and change it.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a function, it is a block of ‘reusable code’ that is used every
        time it is defined. It cuts out the need to write the same code over and
        over again, or go back and edit many lines of code after you’ve written
        it.
