      Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
      you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
      made, and how you reflect on the decision now.

    <p>
      In my company, there was a customer who told us she hadn’t been using the
      software since May. It was August. She asked to cancel her subscription.
      Given I could see her inactivity since May and I had to refund her August
      payment anyway, I also refunded her for the months of May, June and July
      as well, after canceling her subscription. Oftentimes, when it comes to
      money, business can have a profit above all else approach. To me, what
      matters is fair exchange for use of services. While it wasn’t necessary
      for me to refund her for those months, fair exchange and caring about
      people first comes above all else. I’m proud of my decision. Although I
      know a lot of others would disagree with me, I stand by this decision as
      the kind of company I’d like to build. Describe how your culture and the
      people around you have influenced your values and identity. My parents are
      from Guangzhou, China and immigrated to NZ. I am, however, NZ born and
      raised. I believe my culture is almost 90% influenced by NZ/western values
      and ideals. My mother however, did raise me to believe in the validity of
      science and reason. My father followed more eastern spiritual philosophy,
      including the teachings of Lao Tzu and Buddha. I am agnostic and subscribe
      to the basic principles of humanism. Humanists base their understanding of
      the world on reason and science, rejecting supernatural or divine beliefs.
      Humanists reject all forms of racism and prejudice, and believe in
      respecting and protecting everyone's human rights, including the right to
      freedom of religion and belief. Growing up in NZ, I understand and see a
      lot of the benefits of socialism and democracy. I also support social
      enterprise/conscious capitalism. I was introduced to these concepts when I
      began my entrepreneurial journey a decade ago, meeting many entrepreneurs
      from all around the world, including USA, Canada and Europe. Identify your
      strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey. My
      dominating cognitive function is extroverted intuition. It’s purpose
      involves acquiring information from the outside world and prompts
      extraverted exploration in an open-ended fashion. This allows me to
      readily adapt to and blend with my circumstances rather than trying to
      change or control them. I go beyond sensory, objective data using primary
      sense, and to take large amounts of data and discern otherwise hidden
      patterns, possibilities and potentials. It allows me to scan for
      relationships or patterns within a pool of ideas, facts or experiences. In
      conjunction with my secondary function, Introverted Feeling, it helps me
      formulate and modify ideas. This has helped me greatly in innovation,
      conversation, social interaction with different types of people,
      maintaining curiosity, ideation and engagement in the arts. While my
      introverted feelings function (Fi) pushes for closure, my extroverted
      intuition (NE) counters by rallying for more options and alternatives. In
      many cases, Ne wins out, interjecting enough new or contradictory
      information to keep me in a state of perpetual openness or indecision.
      However, being a Type 3 wing 2 enneagram, means that I am prone towards
      high achievement and therefore am able to make firm decisions or
      conclusions faster than my other ENFP counterparts. The one massive
      benefit of the above is I remain very open-minded. I can see truth from
      both sides of an issue without forming premature conclusions. It makes me
      a good listener, always asking questions out of pure curiosity and well
      suited to act as fair and effective arbiters. I also tend to have a deep
      sense of self-awareness of my feelings, who I am as a person and my
      moral/ethical code. I believe this will help me on my learning journey as
      I already have many strong skills when it comes to teamwork,
      collaboration, asking for help and keeping an open, curious mind and
      providing out-of-the-box thinking when it comes to ideas and
      problem-solving. Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and
      career development. How might these affect your learning journey? I have
      very minimal coding experience so learning about github and version
      control concepts is very new to me. Here are some ways my learning
      development might be affected: My dominant cognitive function is
      Extraverted Intuition (Ne) which means I look to the future and prefer
      abstract thinking. I often find myself getting distracted (mild ADHD) and
      focusing on detail oriented tasks or tasks that require full presence can
      be draining for me. I prefer to think about ideas and future
      possibilities. I am constantly generating new ideas, associations and
      quips. I can seem random, scattered, distracted and flighty. My auxiliary
      cognitive function is introverted feeling (FI) so I follow my intuition
      and feelings more than logic when it comes to decision-making. This is
      great when it come to working with people, but oftentimes, it means I will
      choose actions based on what I’m feeling in the moment. Or I’ll prioritize
      my morals/values/ethics even to the detriment of the effectiveness or
      optimization of an activity or my own productivity. Not great for being a
      developer. It doesn’t mean I don’t know what the logical decision is. It
      just means, more often than not, my needs to be a good human outweigh the
      needs to get the best possible outcome in the most effective way. But when
      those things aren’t in contrast with each other, I can definitely make the
      logical decision. I am predominantly a “right-brained type. While the left
      side of the brain is concerned with order, control, and systematizing, the
      right brain is oriented to novelty, people and emotions. The right brain
      is also the more random or ‘creative’ side (divergence) while the left
      hemisphere is concerned with analysis and predictability (convergence).
      While I can use my left brain, it is not as well developed as people with
      dominant Introverted Intuitive or Introverted/Extroverted Thinking
      cognitive functions, as they have years of building that muscle through
      compound effect. My tertiary cognitive function is Extraverted Thinking
      (Te) which means if I’m working on a project, I will look at all available
      information from external sources and use it as a guide for my
      decision-making. The weakest part of my cognitive functions is Introverted
      Sensing (Si) which relies heavily on past experiences to inform my
      decisions. Source: https://personalityjunkie.com/enfp/

    <h3>
      Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others,
      but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the
      time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other
      strategies you would try now and why.
    </h3>

      Oftentimes my co-founder and I have disagreements. We have a great
      friendship and working relationship so having a disagreement doesn’t
      bother us. We have the same cognitive function stack but in opposite
      directions so we’ll go about doing things in completely different ways,
      even to end up at the same result. The best strategies were - if we
      couldn’t do it together, go away, do it separately our own way and come
      back and see if we came to the same conclusion. Don’t try and make the
      other one do it the way I myself would want to. Let them do it their way.
      If one or the other gets mad, one of us will generally concede. We’ll ask
      on a scale of 1-10 how strongly we feel and will let the other know if we
      are about a 5/10 (we don’t really mind either way) or 10/10 (I feel like
      it has to be done that way). If we’re both at a 10/10 for something,
      generally the person who’s area of authority or expertise makes the
      decision. For me, it’s marketing, sales, customer experience/support. For
      her, it’s operations, systems, legal, finances, processes. Generally
      though, the one thing we’ve realized is what one hates or does badly, the
      other either doesn’t mind doing or is really good at it. So the smartest
      way to work productively with others is to humble oneself, make sure you
      learn their strengths and weaknesses, and know yours! And to build the
      rapport so you can know to respect them in their area of expertise or what
      they’re best at. Because once that respect with their competency is there,
      the best strategy for productivity is to hand off the task to the person
      who’s going to do the best job at completing it.
