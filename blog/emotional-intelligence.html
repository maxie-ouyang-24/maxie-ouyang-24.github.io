    <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
      <p>Emotional Intelligence is the ability to understand, use and manage your own emotions in positive ways to relieve stress, communicate effectively, empathize with others, overcome challenges and defuse conflict</p>
      <p>Your EQ measures your emotional intelligence, assessing your ability to identify, manage and express your emotions. Your emotional intelligence skills - like self-awareness, empathy and self motivation - help you name your feelings and consequent behaviour to then recognize it more easily in others.</p>

    <h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
      <p>Your IQ measures your capacity to learn, comprehend, and apply knowledge to daily tasks. This involves several skills, like logic and verbal communication. And developing your IQ involves learning how to filter out irrelevant information, retain important details, and solve complex issues.</p>

    <h3>EQ vs IQ</h3>
      <p><b>Using EQ:</b> If you're working with a difficult client, your emotional intelligence gives you the tools to approach the situation calmly and professionally. And developing your emotional intelligence skills helps you become a more self-aware and supportive communicator.</p>
      <p><b>Using IQ:</b>Imagine the same difficult client. Your IQ provides the necessary resources to create an effective communication strategy. You organize your thoughts and communicate clear, persuasive details to reassure your troubled listener.</p>

      <p><b>Here's another example:</b></p>
      <p>Your best workmate pops into your DMs and asks if you can chat. They're working on a challenging project teeming with obstacles, making it hard for them to stay motivated and focused.</p>
      <p><ol>You either:</ol>
        <li>Offer a listening ear, lend your support, and assure them they'll get through it.</li>
        <li>Provide your professional opinon on breaking down each roadblock.</li>
      </p>
      <p>The first response showcases your emotional quotient (EQ): your ability to understand and manage your emotions and those of others.
  The second response uses your intelligent quotient (IQ): your capacity for problem-solving, critical thinking and logical reasoning.
      </p>
    <h2>Why is EQ Important?</h2>
      <p>Emotional intelligence helps you build stronger relationships, succeed at school and work, and achieve your career and personal goals. It can also help you to connect with your feelings, turn intention into action, and make informed decisions about what matters most to you.</p>
